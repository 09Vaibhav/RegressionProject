# RegressionProject

In this Project , i have extracted data from kaggle combined cycle powerplant (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gova26/airpressure?resource=download)
Then i have applied various regression technique to find out which one gives the best result.
The Regression techniques that i have used are Multiple Linear Regression , Polynomial Regression , SVR , Decision Tree and Random Forest.
The accuracy i have calculated using r2_score .
Out of the above mentioned techniques used, Decision Tree is giving the poor accuracy (92.92 %) and Random Forest is giving the best accuracy (96.15 %)
